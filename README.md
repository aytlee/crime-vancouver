Data Visualization Exercise of Vancouver Crime Statistics

This notebook was created to learn how to use geopandas, get more experience with seaborn, and how to plot time series data. All of the data is taken from Vancouver's Open Data Catalogue and uses the public streets, neighbourhood and crime statistics from the website.
